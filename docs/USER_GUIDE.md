## Assessing a Participant

### Open Assessment
From the participant list, click on a participant's name to open their assessment form.

### Navigate Between Components
The assessment is organized by components (such as "Airway Management" or "Electrical Therapies"). Use the tabs at the top to switch between different components.

### Score an Outcome
For each outcome listed, select a score using the **Bondy Scale** buttons (I, S, A, M, N). The buttons show color-coded feedback:
- **I (Green)** = Independent - No cues needed
- **S (Light Green)** = Supervised - Occasional cues
- **A (Yellow)** = Assisted - Frequent cues
- **M (Orange)** = Marginal - Continuous cues
- **N (Gray)** = Not Observed - Not demonstrated

### Use Quick Pass
If the participant demonstrates competence in all mandatory outcomes for a component, click the **QUICK PASS** button. This automatically marks all mandatory outcomes as "Independent" in one action. Optional outcomes remain unchanged.

### Add Feedback
Use the **Component Feedback** text area to record specific comments about the participant's performance in that component. This feedback saves automatically as you type.

### Set Engagement Level
At the bottom of the assessment, select the participant's overall engagement level using the emoji scale:
- 😞 = Very poor engagement
- 🙁 = Poor engagement
- 😐 = Adequate engagement
- 🙂 = Good engagement
- 😁 = Excellent engagement

### Add Overall Feedback
In the **Overall Feedback** text area, record any final comments about the participant's overall performance across all components.

### Automatic Saving
All changes are saved automatically. Watch for the "Saved" indicator at the top of the form to confirm your data has been saved.

## Using the Dashboard

### Access the Dashboard
From the participant list page, click the **Dashboard** button to view a complete overview of all participants and their assessment progress.

### Understand the Status Colors
The dashboard uses color-coded cells to show assessment status:
- **Green** = Component assessment complete and passed
- **Yellow** = Component assessment in progress
- **Gray** = Component assessment not started
- **Orange** = Issues detected (marginal or not observed scores on mandatory outcomes)

### View Assessment Details
Click on any cell in the grid to see details about that participant's assessment in that component, including specific scores and feedback.

### Expand Participant Feedback
Click on a participant's row to see all feedback provided for that participant across all components.

### Filter and Sort
Use the filter controls to show:
- **All Participants** - Show everyone
- **Incomplete** - Show only participants with unfinished assessments
- **Complete** - Show only participants with finished assessments

Sort participants by:
- **Name** - Alphabetical order
- **Progress** - Most complete assessments first

### View Feedback Panel
Click **Feedback** to open an expandable panel showing all feedback comments from all assessors. This includes component-specific feedback and overall feedback, with assessor names and timestamps.

### Real-Time Updates
The dashboard updates automatically when other assessors enter data. Watch the sync indicator in the top right to see your connection status.

## Bondy Scale Reference

The Bondy Scale is a 5-point competency assessment tool:

| Score | Label | Code | What It Means |
|-------|-------|------|---|
| 5 | Independent | I | Safe, accurate, and proficient. No cues needed. |
| 4 | Supervised | S | Safe and accurate. Occasional supportive cues required. |
| 3 | Assisted | A | Safe but requires frequent verbal or physical directive cues. |
| 2 | Marginal | M | Unsafe; continuous cues required. |
| 1 | Not Observed | N | Skill was not observed or demonstrated during assessment. |

## Tips for Efficient Assessment

### Multiple Assessors Can Work Simultaneously
You and other assessors can assess different participants at the same time without conflicts. All changes sync in real-time.

### Use Quick Pass for Efficiency
If a participant clearly demonstrates competence across all mandatory outcomes in a component, use the **QUICK PASS** button instead of clicking each outcome individually. This saves time and is easily undone if needed.

### Check the Dashboard Before Session End
Use the dashboard view to ensure all participants have been assessed before the course ends. The progress bar shows overall completion status.

### Dashboard Refreshes Automatically
You don't need to manually refresh - the dashboard updates every 5 seconds and shows changes from all assessors in real-time.

### Feedback Is Mandatory
Always provide specific feedback in the feedback areas. This helps participants understand their performance and supports future learning.

## Troubleshooting

### Save Indicator Not Appearing
If you don't see a "Saved" indicator, wait a few seconds. Changes are queued and will be saved when the connection is available.

### Can't Find a Participant
Use the search box on the participant list to find by name. Ensure you're viewing the correct course date.

### Assessment Won't Load
Check your internet connection and try refreshing the page. If the problem persists, contact your administrator.

### Session Expired
You may be logged out if you close the browser or after an extended period of inactivity (typically 12 hours). Simply log in again with your name and PIN.
